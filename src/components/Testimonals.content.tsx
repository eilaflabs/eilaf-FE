Thank you so, so much for on short notice physically coming to the office, taking care of the problem, and ensuring proper steps for problem resolution. It is very rare that you find a service company that is willing to come out late in the evening, especially when just being called. HMB Tech has always provided us with top quality service and treats us like a valued customer. You are so responsive to our needs and treat us like a family rather than just a customer. Beyond our true appreciation and thanks, please let me know if now, or at anytime, we can write reviews, help your business grow, write recommendation letters, etc... It would be my pleasure to help your business grow as you have done such a fabulous job for us. Thank you",

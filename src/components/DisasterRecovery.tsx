              If something happened and your valuable business data was lost,
              what would you do? Would you be able to recover or would you go
              out of business? How fast would you be able to recover? Making
              sure you have a well designed disaster recovery plan in place is
              the single most important thing any business owner should do. Yet,
              many business owners donâ€™t even think about it until the worse
              happens.
